Welcome to my Personal Portfolio. This website has been built using a theme provided by Hugo and hosted on Netlify. I am responsible for pushing the updated code (My content in JSON format) into the repository and Github Actions takes care of the rest. It has a workflow to compile the code and complete build process and live changes are visible on the site. Along with my portfolio, you can find articles on AWS, Docker, Ansible and Kubernetes. A newbie could get hold of these topics after going through the articles as I have attached live demonstration of these tools using Asciinema terminal recording.
