# Satwik's Portfolio
Welcome to my Personal Portfolio, a one-stop place for my professional ventures and personal projects. This website has been built using a theme provided by Hugo and hosted on Netlify. CI/CD has been enabled for this site using Github ACtions. You can also find articles on AWS, Docker, Ansible and Kubernetes. A newbie could get hold of these topics after going through the articles, along with Proof of Concept guiding throughout (recorded terminals using Asciinema).
