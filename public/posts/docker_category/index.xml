      <description>Making a Docker container for Hugo site by following a Youtube tutorial.
  Made two directories namely ansible-build and docker-build in the Hugo repository. Shifted content of Hugo website to Docker-build.
  Made a Dockerfile. Specified Nginx static file location and localhost ports in the file.
  Built the Docker container and ran it. Failed in the earlier attempt since I forgot to make Dockerfile.</description>

      <description>Attempted locally hosting the docker image.
  Created index.md and about.md files in a repository.
  Used command docker run -d -p 8000:80 -v ~/nginxtrial:/usr/share/nginx/md --name trialsite nginx to run it. trialsite is the name of the image here.   But when launched the docker container on port 8000, it displayed error 404:Not found.
  Repeated the same process, but with index.html and about.</description>

      <description>GroupAdded Docker and added a user to avoid usage of sudo everytime, using command $sudo usermod -aG docker $USER.    Tried creating my first Docker container but failed, due to denial of some permissions.    Tried pulling Nginx image, but failed due to lack of storage. My Asciinema recording stopped abruptly due to the same.    Working with containers.</description>
