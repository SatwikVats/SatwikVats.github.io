- **Hugo** is a popular framework for building sites and personal blogs. It has a vast set of catchy templates already available on its site and an individual can make his/her site on similar lines. It can be deployed using various CI/CD techniques through [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-github-pages) and [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/blog/automate-your-static-site-deployment-with-circleci/).
