- Tried exploring Docker and Ansible technologies.

- Had a healthy group discussion with my friends on the same, where we shared our ideas on both the technologies mentioned above.Many of our misconceptions were cleared up, and we divided responsibilities amongst us.


- Since the past few days, I have been trying to figure out how to enable full-screen display for my VM.
  * After several futile attempts of installing new ISOGuestAdditions and changing disc image, found a different method in a [Youtube guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtGvtgnLiE8).
  * In the virtualBox Manager, altered a few settings. Increased Video memory and changed Graphics Controller to VBoxSVGA.
  * Restarted the machine and got desired results.

- Follow-up process in an attempt to deploy full-screen through GuestAdditionsISO.
