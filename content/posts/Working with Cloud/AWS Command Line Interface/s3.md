## Creating an S3 Storage Bucket

  - You may create a Bucket manually on Console or using AWS CLI.
  
    ```
    #Made a bucket on CLI.
    aws s3 mb s3://skvfirstbucket

    #Generating list of all the buckets.
    aws s3 ls
    
    ```

## Copying a file to bucket.

  - Here, `file.txt` is the filename and `skvfirstbucket` is the bucket name.

    ```
    aws s3 cp file.txt s3://skvfirstbucket/
    
    ```
    
## Syncing local directory to AWS Bucket. 

  - A backup for Hugo Site content is being created here. The path of directory as source along with bucket as target must be specified.

    ```
    aws s3 sync /home/satwik/HugoFirstSite.io/content s3://skvfirstbucket/HugoSiteContent
    
    ```

  - If any changes are made to the local directory, those changes are updated in the bucket as well, on syncing again.
  
  - But here comes a twist.. Things don't work out as expected when it comes to delete operations. To sync delete operations, `--delete` must be used in the command to enforce removal of file.
    
    ```
    aws s3 sync /home/satwik/HugoFirstSite.io/content s3://skvfirstbucket/HugoSiteContent --delete
    
    ```

  - Removing a file from bucket.

    ```
    aws s3 rm s3://skvfirstbucket/file.txt
    
    ```
    {{<asciinema 0CvOHDL3VH6v6bFvPmAPvrXGA>}}
    
  - AWS doesn't permit removal of non-empty buckets directly. `--force` must be used in the command to enforce removal.

    ```
    aws s3 rb s3://skvfirstbucket --force 
    
    ```
