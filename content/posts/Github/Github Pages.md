- Experimented around and created a page of my own using Github Pages.
  [My first Github Page](https://satwikvats.github.io/)

- Added some more content to my website and made changes.

- To sort out the issues as mentioned in the previous update, tried changing the remote repository with my Hugo content to '<username>.github.io'.

- After deliberation with my teammates and figuring out the errors, finally managed to host this site successfully.
